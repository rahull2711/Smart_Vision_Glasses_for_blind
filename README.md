# Smart_Vision_Glasses_for_blind
To help the visually impaired people, a decision was made to gather today’s top technology and
create a device that can help them overcome their disability. It is not sustainable that in the 21st
century, there are still people who aren’t getting the full experience and favor from technology.
That’s why a device was created to aid them to perform their activities. It can assist them to
overcome their daily obstacles. It can help them move more freely. As it also can boost their
confidence. Achieving this project will create a device that draws a direct connection between
the visually impaired and machine.
Create a device that boosts the safety of the visually impaired while living their everyday life.
This device will make the visually impaired more accepted in society because they will be able
to achieve more tasks than they used to, (knowing that some of them are essential). The product
will allow the user to comprehend life around them. They will be able to experience life more
dynamically and live it in an upgraded manner. It will elevate the user’s self-esteem and make
them raise their confidence while doing any task possible. It will make their life easier due to
its connection with the evolution of technology.
The aim of this project is to develop a smart lens for visually impaired individuals that can
detect and announce the presence of objects along with their respective distances. The
proposed smart lens will leverage object detection techniques and a speaker to provide users
with real-time feedback about their surroundings, enabling them to navigate more effectively
and safely.
The smart lens will consist of a camera that captures images of the user's surroundings and
12
sends them to a machine learning model for object detection. The model will analyze the
images and identify any objects that are present, as well as their respective distances. Once an
object has been detected, a speaker will announce the object and its distance to the user in
real-time. The system will be designed to work in a range of environments, including indoors
and outdoors, and will be compact and easy to use. The project consists of one product that
acts as the eyes of the blind and much more. It takes orders and helps them fulfill their desired
tasks.
These features are dependent on each other to communicate and execute actions that suit the
user the best. This product is expected to achieve many tasks that help blind people. It is
expected to act as their eyes and help them in many ways.
The key features of this project include
Obstacle Detection: The smart glasses incorporate advanced computer vision algorithms to
detect obstacles in the user's path, providing real-time alerts and enhancing their mobility and
safety. These glasses will assist users in navigating their surroundings, recognizing objects, and
reading text in real time.
Virtual Assistant: A powerful virtual assistant is integrated into the glasses, enabling users to
ask questions and receive instant responses. From performing calculations and checking
weather forecasts to accessing news headlines, Google Maps locations, music playback,
Wikipedia information, and conducting online searches, the virtual assistant offers a wide
range of functionalities.
By combining these features, the Smart-Vision Glasses project aims to create a comprehensive
and empowering solution for individuals with visual impairments, enhancing their
accessibility, independence, and engagement in various aspects of their daily lives
